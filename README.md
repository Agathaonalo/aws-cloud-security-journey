##  The Learning Path

### 🟢 Phase 1: Cloud Architecture & Foundations
*Building the bedrock: Compute, Storage, Networking, and Architecture.*

- [ ] **Security & Identity Management (IAM)** - *Understanding the Shared Responsibility Model*
- [ ] **Networking & Content Delivery** - *VPC Design, Subnets, Routing, and CloudFront*
- [ ] **Compute Services** - *EC2, Lambda, and Serverless concepts*
- [ ] **Storage Solutions** - *S3, EBS, and Lifecycle Policies*
- [ ] **Database Fundamentals** - *RDS, DynamoDB, and Purpose-built databases*
- [ ] **The Well-Architected Framework** - *Designing for cost, speed, and security*
- [ ] **Monitoring & Scaling** - *CloudWatch, Auto Scaling, and High Availability*

### 🟡 Phase 2: Cloud Security Specialization
*Deep dive into securing the cloud infrastructure and data.*

- [ ] **Security Design Principles** - *Least Privilege & Defense in Depth*
- [ ] **Identity & Access Management (Deep Dive)** - *Policies, Roles, and Federation*
- [ ] **Infrastructure Security** - *Hardening VPCs, Security Groups, and NACLs*
- [ ] **Data Protection** - *Encryption at Rest/Transit and Key Management (KMS)*
- [ ] **Logging & Monitoring Strategy** - *CloudTrail, Security Hub, and Auditing*
- [ ] **Incident Response** - *Automated remediation and threat detection*

### 🔴 Phase 3: Portfolio Projects (Proof of Work)
*Applying knowledge to build real-world, secure infrastructure.*
